Transcribe & Force-Align English, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.

Transcribe any languages supported by Whisper
(manually type in the 2 digit language code in the language drop down.)

Utilize the built in transcription editor to fix your transcriptions.

#	USAGE	#
#############

REQUIREMENTS:
- Windows operating system (for Japanese transcriptions only)
- NVIDIA GPU (you can try CPU inference, but it probably won't work well.)

HOW TO INSTALL:
1: Run "installer.bat". This will do a few things:
- Download and install all models + files needed for SOFA_GUI to function.
- Automatically set up the python environment for Whisper and SOFA.

2: Run "run.bat" to use the program!

3: Place all of your files in the "corpus" folder, in this format. There is no limit to how many speakers you can run at one time, but the more files you have, the longer it will take.

corpus
|	{name_of_speaker_1}
|	|	wav1.wav
|	|	wav2.wav
|	|	...
|	{name_of_speaker_2}
|	|	wav1.wav
|	|	wav2.wav
|	|	...

4: The transcription tab will run the Whisper transcriptions. The default whisper model is "medium", but if you have ~10GB VRAM available, you should change it to "large" in the settings! Otherwise, the difference is small.

5: Then, after running the transcription, you can go to the "Align" tab and run SOFA! If your transcriptions are in English, select "tgm_sofa". If your transcriptions are Japanese, select "colstone_jpn". If your transcriptions are in Mandarin Chinese, select "mandarin_suco".

If you get this warning on the command line:

"You are using a CUDA device ('{your_gpu}') that has Tensor Cores. To properly utilize them, you should set `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('medium' | 'high')` which will trade-off precision for performance. For more details, read https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.set_float32_matmul_precision.html#torch.set_float32_matmul_precision"

Then please enable "Use Tensorcores" in the settings menu! This will fully utilize your GPU, speeding up forced-alignments!
